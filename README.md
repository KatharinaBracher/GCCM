# GCCM
## R Code
The `basic.r` script includes functions for statistical analysis, data manipulation, and distance computation: tools for calculating confidence intervals and significance of correlation coefficients, expanding matrices with NA values, generating lagged variables, and computing distances between variables, handling both categorical and numeric data. Additionally, it provides functions for generating and extracting embeddings based on specified attributes and lags, normalizing data, and identifying Pareto fronts.

The `GCCM.r` script for the raster example includes functions for performing cross-mapping using so called library and prediction indices, computing distances between embeddings, and making predictions based on nearest neighbors. The script supports parallel processing to handle large datasets efficiently and includes comprehensive functions for setting up and running GCCM analysis, including embedding preparation and statistical evaluation of prediction accuracy.
